This is a significant rewrite that we expect to greatly improve the performance and stability of the Android SDK. Please refer to the change log below as well as the updated README.md.

### Breaking changes

- Removed access to the Sift instance and renamed a few hooks. Everything should be invoked via the static call to the singleton class.
    - `Sift.get().save()`  is now  `Sift.pause()`
    - `Sift.get().setUserId(…)`  is now  `Sift.setUserId(…)`
    - `Sift.get().unsetUserId(…)`  is now  `Sift.unsetUserId(…)`
    - Removed support for  `Sift.get.upload(…)`
- Removed the optional location permissions from sift SDK AndroidManifest.xml. As such, you will need to add  `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`  and  `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`  to your own application’s AndroidManifest.xml if you would like to enable location collection
